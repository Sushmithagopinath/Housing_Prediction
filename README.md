# Housing Prediction
> A US-based housing company named Surprise Housing has decided to enter the Australian market. The company uses data analytics to purchase houses at a price below their actual values and flip them on at a higher price. For the same purpose, the company has collected a data set from the sale of houses in Australia. From which it requires to predict the prices.

## General Information
The company is looking at prospective properties to buy to enter the market. You are required to build a regression model using regularisation in order to predict the actual value of the prospective properties and decide whether to invest in them or not.

Buisness Goal It will be used by the management to understand how exactly the demands vary with different features.They will know

Which variables are significant in predicting the price of a house, and

How well those variables describe the price of a house.

This will be done with a model which is built with the price of houses with the available independent variables. This model will then be used by the management to understand how exactly the prices vary with the variables. They can accordingly manipulate the strategy of the firm and concentrate on areas that will yield high returns. Further, the model will be a good way for management to understand the pricing dynamics of a new market. Ridge and Lasso Regeression
## Conclusions
- Metrics like R-Squared, MSE and RMSE have been generated on training and testing data for ridge and lasso regression models
- Optimal lambda value for Ridge is found to be 0.2
- Optimal lambda value for Lasso is found to be 50
- Top 10 predictors were obtained which well describe the models
